> image work (organizing) for designing with machine learning final

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Create virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To Run

You'll need to create an `images/` folder in the root of this directory, which will contain all your images to do the machine learning on. You'll also need to create an empty `resized/` folder.

Then, just do:

```
python image_sort.py
```

And you're good.
